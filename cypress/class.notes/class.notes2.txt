  02.Cypress commands and locators





   2 ways to locate elements : X-Path 
                              CSS selectors


     

Cypress, by design, does not natively support XPath because its creators aimed 
to encourage more maintainable and readable tests using CSS selectors, 
which are typically faster and more reliable in web applications.
If you still need to use XPath selectors, you can add support by installing a plugin.


      Can locate using tags => input : radio-buttons, Checkboxes, Dropdowns, forms
                            button
                            li
                            div
                            <a> (anchor tag)
                            <h1>



      Can locate using symbols

 

  # - locates by id
  . - locates by class




Child, descendant, adjacent sibling selectors

  

>       - child selector
   /**
     * Child Selector ( > ) *
     * 
     * Description: Targets direct children of a specified parent element.
     */

    cy.get('#checkbox-button-group > h3')

    cy.get('#checkbox-button-group > div > #apple_check > #checkbox_1')

    cy.get('#checkbox-button-group > div > .checkbox > #checkbox_1.mr-2')








(Space) - descendant selector

Descendant Selector (space):

Description: Targets elements nested anywhere within a specific parent.

Example: (div a) will select all <a> elements inside a <div>,





Adjacent Sibling Selector (+):

Description: Targets an element immediately after another specified element at the same level in the hierarchy.
Example: (a + a) will target the second <a> if it directly follows the first one.




Grouping Selector (comma, ,):
Description: Combines multiple selectors into one rule set, allowing you to style different elements with the same set of styles.
Example: (p, span) selects the both <p> and <span> web elements.






*       -wildcard, matches any element

*: Matches every element on the page.
div > *: Matches all direct children of a <div>, regardless of what type of element they are.
.class *: Matches all descendants of an element with the class "class", no matter how deeply nested they are.






           ATRIBUTE SELECTORS


[attribute]: Targets elements with a specific attribute, regardless of its value.
                Ex: input[type] will select all <input> elements that have a type attribute, regardless of the value of it.



[attribute=value]: Targets elements with a specific attribute and value.
                Ex: input[type="text"] will select only <input> elements with a "type" attribute value of "text".


[attribute^=value]: Matches elements with an attribute value that starts with a specific string.
                Ex: a[href^="https://"] will select all links starting with "https://".


[attribute$=value]: Matches elements with an attribute value that ends with a       specific string.
                Ex: a[href$=".jpg"] will select all links that end with ".jpg".



[attribute*=value]: Matches elements with an attribute value containing a specific substring.
                Ex: a[href*="openai"] will select links containing the substring "openai" in the href,
                                                                       such as "https://www.openai.com".
