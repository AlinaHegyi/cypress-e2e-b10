    Cypress config 

	cypress.config.js 	=> Thats a configuration where you can change, and overwrite some settings about your tests, and the runner.

	When you install, this file comes empty, but it doesn't means it is empty. Because there are pre-defined DEFAULT options. 

	So, if you want to see this default options, you will find them in the settings of the Cypress Test Runner.



    How many types of folders that Cypress comes with ?


	- fixtures 	=> Its a directory where we hold our external test data.


	- support 	=> In this folder, we will find 2 files
			 - commands.js => Its place where we can create global functions.
			 - e2e.js	  => This file, always runs ONCE before each tests in the e2e folder.

						
	- e2e		=> This is folder where we store all our test files.


	- Assets folder => There is no folder called 'Assets' in Cypress. 
                         This is group of folders, that is being created once we need them.
                         Eg: videos, screenshots




    
	- describe() 	-> Is a method that holds group of tests in a single file.

	- it()			-> Used to define individual test cases.
